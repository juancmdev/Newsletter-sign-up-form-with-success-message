### What I learned

In this project I learned many new things, especially capturing input data and being able to do something with it.

```js
const formData = new FormData(e.target);
const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);
```

### Continued development

I'm learning React and Astro to be able to build more interactive and easy-to-maintain sites.
